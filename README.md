## Decentralize application for Media Sharing 

This decentalize application is used for both Video (phase 1) and Image (phase 2) sharing. The media file will be stored in IPFS, The InterPlanetary File System, which is an peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. The file store in the IPFS will be immutable. The media record is stored in an Ethereum blockchain, so the media record can be immutable as well.

## Project Plan
<LI> NOW Phase 1: Video sharing with Simple UI
<LI> Phase 2: Video and Image sharing with Simple UI
<LI> Phase 3: Enhance UI
<LI> Phase 4: Multiple User supports and Mechanism for Tip, Change of Ownership, ...etc
